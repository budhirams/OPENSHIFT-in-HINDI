A bastion host is a server whose purpose is to provide access to a private network from an external network, such as the internet.

How it works (easy flow)
users -->Bastion Servers ---> Private server
- user connects to bastion (public IP)
- Bastion connects to private network servers
- private servers have no public IP

matlab bastion host ke through hi aap all cluster nodes ko access kr sakten hai , direct aap cluster node ko access nhi kr sakten hai 

bastion par kya hota hai ?
- openshift-install
- oc CLI
- SSH keys
- kubeconfig
- DNS/LB access

bastion host kya hota hai just create a instance in a public subnet
